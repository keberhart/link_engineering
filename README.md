   1. This library uses many of the ideas and equations from;
       "Link Performance Analysis for a Proposed Future Architecture of the
       Air Force Satellite Control Network" by Eric W. Nelson, USAF

   2. Just like Cpt. Nelson I also referenced;
       "DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook" 810-005 rev. E

   3. I have also used;
       "Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas" by Sophocles J. Orfanidis

   4. Noise figure calculations and antenna effective aperature were taken
       from the source code of "Virgo: A Versatile Spectrometer for Radio
       Astronomy" by Apostolos Spanakis-Misirlis, Cameron L. Van Eck and
       E.p. Boven

   5. "Antenna Models For Electromagnetic Compatability Analyses"
          NTIA TM-12-489, C.W Wang Ph.D., T. Keech, Ph.D.
