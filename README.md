   1. This library uses many of the ideas and equations from;
       "Link Performance Analysis for a Proposed Future Architecture of the
       Air Force Satellite Control Network" by Eric W. Nelson, USAF

   2. Just like Cpt. Nelson I also referenced;
       "DSN Telecommunications Link Design Handbook" 810-005 rev. E

   3. I have also used;
       "Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas" by Sophocles J. Orfanidis
